### What is CSS 
``` 
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
  
```
### Why use CSS 
 ```
 CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
```

### CSS Solved a Big Problem
```HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

<h1>This is a heading</h1>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page! 
```
### CSS Saves a Lot of Work!
```The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.

With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
```

### CSS syntax 
``` A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. 
The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces. 

```p {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
}```

 Example Explained
p is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: <p>).
color is a property, and red is the property value
text-align is a property, and center is the property value

 ```
