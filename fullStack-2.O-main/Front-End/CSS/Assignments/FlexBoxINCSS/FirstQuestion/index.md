### Describe the main differeces between the CSS Flexbox layout model andd the CSS Grid layout model. When wouldd yuo choose to use one over the other? 
```CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid are both layout models in CSS, but they have different purposes and are used in different scenarios.

### CSS Flexbox:

1. **One-Dimensional Layout:** Flexbox is primarily used for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or column. It's ideal for laying out items in a single direction.

2. **Content-Based Sizing:** It's great for creating flexible and responsive layouts where items can grow and shrink based on available space.

3. **Alignment and Justification:** Flexbox provides powerful alignment and justification properties, allowing you to easily center items both horizontally and vertically.

4. **Ordering:** It allows you to change the order of elements regardless of their source order in the HTML.

5. **Dynamic or Unknown Sizes:** Flexbox is particularly useful when dealing with dynamic or unknown sizes of elements.

6. **Great for Navigational Menus, Toolbars, and Aligning UI Elements:** It's commonly used for items that need to be aligned along a single axis.

### CSS Grid:

1. **Two-Dimensional Layout:** Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to define both rows and columns explicitly.

2. **Grid Lines and Cells:** It enables precise control over the placement of items in both rows and columns, making it great for complex layouts.

3. **Fixed or Flexible Sizing:** Grid allows you to define fixed or flexible sizes for rows and columns.

4. **Alignment, Justification, and Distribution:** It offers control over alignment, justification, and distribution of items within both rows and columns.

5. **Perfect for Complex Grid Structures:** Grid is excellent for creating complex layouts with multiple rows and columns, such as grid-based designs found in magazines or newspapers.

6. **Control Over Spacing and Overlapping:** It provides fine-grained control over the spacing between items and even allows for items to overlap.

### When to Choose Which:

1. **Use Flexbox When:**
   - You're working with a one-dimensional layout (row or column).
   - You need to align items along a single axis.
   - You want elements to dynamically adjust their sizes.

2. **Use Grid When:**
   - You're working with a two-dimensional layout.
   - You need precise control over the placement of items in both rows and columns.
   - You're creating complex, grid-based designs.

3. **Use Both Together When:**
   - Combining Flexbox and Grid allows you to create very powerful and flexible layouts, where Flexbox handles the alignment of items along one axis and Grid handles the overall structure of the layout.

In practice, it's common to use both Flexbox and Grid together to take advantage of the strengths of each layout model. They complement each other well and can be used in combination to create sophisticated and responsive web layouts.```
