What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the
'let' keyword?

Declaring variables in JavaScript serves the purpose of allocating memory to store data that can be manipulated, accessed, and reused throughout the code. Variables act as containers that hold values like numbers, strings, objects, etc. Declaring a variable is like creating a labeled storage space in the computer's memory.

In JavaScript, you can declare variables using different keywords, such as let, const, and var. Here's how you declare a variable using the let keyword:

let myVariable;

The let keyword is used to declare a variable in JavaScript. Here's a breakdown:

let: It's a modern way to declare variables introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6). It allows you to declare variables that can be reassigned new values.

let myNumber = 10;
let myString = "Hello, World!";

This code snippet declares two variables, myNumber and myString, and assigns a number and a string value to them, respectively. The let keyword signifies that these variables can have their values changed or reassigned later in the code.

Variables declared with let have block scope, which means they are only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces {}) in which they are defined or declared. This helps in preventing variable leaks or unintended use outside their intended scope.

Declaring variables using let enables developers to manage and store data efficiently, allowing for easier manipulation and retrieval of values throughout the execution of the JavaScript code.
