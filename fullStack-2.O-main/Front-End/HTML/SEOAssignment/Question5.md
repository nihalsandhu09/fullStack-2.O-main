### define favixon and give a illustrative example 
```A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small, typically square-shaped image or icon associated with a website. It is displayed in various places within a web browser, such as in the address bar, next to the page's title in a browser tab, and in bookmarks or favorites lists. Favicon images are often 16x16 pixels in size and use the ICO file format, though other formats like PNG are also supported.

Here's an illustrative example:

Let's say you visit a website, such as "www.example.com". In your browser's address bar, you'll see a small icon to the left of the web address. This icon is the favicon, and it's designed to represent the website. For example, if "www.example.com" is a blog about photography, the favicon might be a tiny camera icon. This helps users quickly identify and distinguish between different tabs or bookmarks when they have multiple pages open.

Keep in mind that while 16x16 pixels is the standard size for favicons, some modern displays and browsers may support higher resolution favicons, such as 32x32 or 64x64 pixels, for a crisper appearance on high-density screens.```
