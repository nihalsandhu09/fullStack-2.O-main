### list out the feature  of HTML5 
```
HTML5, the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, introduced a number of new features and improvements for creating web content. Here are some of the key features of HTML5:

Semantic Elements:

<header>, <footer>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <figure>, <figcaption>, <main>, <mark>, <time>, <progress>, <output>, and more. These elements provide a clearer structure and meaning to web content.
Audio and Video Support:

<audio> and <video> elements allow embedding multimedia content directly into web pages without relying on third-party plugins like Flash.
Canvas:

The <canvas> element provides a drawing space for creating graphics, animations, and interactive elements using JavaScript.
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG):

HTML5 supports SVG, which allows for the creation of vector graphics that can be scaled and manipulated using CSS and JavaScript.
Geolocation API:

HTML5 introduced a Geolocation API that enables websites to access and use the user's geographical location.
Local Storage and Session Storage:

The localStorage and sessionStorage APIs allow web applications to store data persistently or temporarily within the browser.
Web Storage:

Provides a way to store key/value pairs locally in a web browser. This is more efficient and secure compared to cookies.
Web Workers:

Web Workers allow scripts to run in the background, separate from the main page, enabling multi-threading and improving performance for complex web applications.
Web Sockets:

Web Sockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, allowing for real-time data exchange between the client and server.
Server-Sent Events:

This feature enables a unidirectional event stream from the server to the client, allowing for real-time updates without the need for polling.
Form Control Enhancements:

New input types such as date, email, tel, number, and more, as well as attributes like required, placeholder, and pattern for better form validation and user interaction.
Drag and Drop API:

HTML5 provides a standardized way to implement drag-and-drop functionality, making it easier to move elements around on a web page.
ContentEditable Attribute:

The contenteditable attribute allows users to edit the content of an element directly on the page, enabling the creation of web-based text editors and rich content applications.
Responsive Design:

HTML5 encourages the use of flexible grids and media queries to create websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
New Document Structure:

Introduces simplified and more flexible doctype declaration (<!DOCTYPE html>), making it easier to start writing HTML documents.
Browser Storage Management:

The navigator.storage API allows developers to query and manage storage usage, helping to optimize and improve web application performance.
Improved Accessibility Features:

HTML5 includes elements and attributes that make it easier to create accessible web content, such as the aria-* attributes for ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) support.```
