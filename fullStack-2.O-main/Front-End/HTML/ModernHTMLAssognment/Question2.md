### What are HTML entities? List out 5 commonly used HTML entities 
```HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have a specific meaning or reserved function in HTML, such as `<`, `>`, `&`, and non-breaking spaces. They ensure that these characters are displayed correctly in the browser, rather than being interpreted as part of the HTML code.

Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

1. `&lt;` - Represents the less-than sign `<`.
2. `&gt;` - Represents the greater-than sign `>`.
3. `&amp;` - Represents the ampersand `&`.
4. `&quot;` - Represents the double quotation mark `"`.
5. `&nbsp;` - Represents a non-breaking space, which prevents browsers from collapsing multiple consecutive spaces into a single space.

These entities are especially important when you want to display special characters or symbols on a web page without them being misinterpreted as part of the HTML structure.```
